# Data structures

# Tag
We can write a description here, and then start defining the properties
with the following headline (or as below for Post, just start with the
properties right away):

## Properties
- id: (number, required)
- name: (string, required)
- slugs: (array[string])


# Publisher::Post
Although it is not necessary or recommended to use the publishing
service's name as a prefix to the published object, we want to test
that Lacerda just ignores the Publisher:: prefix in this case.

## Properties
- id: (number, required)
- title: (string, required)
- tag: (Tag)
